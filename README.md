# Fifa_WorldCup

```
In this project, data extraction is performed on all the matches of the FIFA World Cup using web scraping with the BeautifulSoup library.

The extracted data is then subjected to data cleaning techniques using Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks.

Once the data is cleaned, it is exported to a CSV file for further implementation of the corresponding predictive analysis
